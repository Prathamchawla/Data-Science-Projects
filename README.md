# Data-Science-Projects

This folder contains the projects in which I used a Proper Data Science Pipeline.
Data Science Pipeline:

I started with the data collection and then perfrom the ETL Process with help of Business Intelligence Tools(SSIS(SQL Server Integration Services) and SSMS(SQL Server Managment Studio)).

After saving the data in SSMS, We can connect it to Power BI for Analysis and Visualization or Connect it to Jupyter Notebook for Modeling.

After Modeling, Model Evaluation is necessary for checking the accuracy of the model.

Once the evaluation is done after that we can create a Web API using Flask and Deploy our Model
