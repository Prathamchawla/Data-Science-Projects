# Modeling
In Modeling first I loaded the data through connecting python with the SSMS database 
Used NLP(TF-IDF) for feature extraction and Cosine Similarity for finding the similarities between features...
Created a Recommendation functon and pickle it.

# FLASK
Loaded the pickle file 
created a route and a function for getting the data and to generate the output.
create html templates.

Can't able to upload the pickled file beacuse the size was too big.
